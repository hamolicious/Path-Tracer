# Ray-Caster
A Ray Casting engine I wrote using Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.

It's still a very much work in progress as I still want to do the following:
<li> Clean up the structure of my code
<li> Speed up rendering times
<li> Add colour to the spheres
<li> Add reflections <- In Progress
<li> Clean up light colours to be more smooth
