# Path-Tracer
A Path Tracing engine I wrote using Python 3.8 and Pygame 2.

**This project has been upgraded and the approach modified in [this](https://github.com/hamolicious/Ray-Marching) repository.**

It's still a very much work in progress as I still want to do the following:
<li> Speed up rendering times
<li> Create a GUI for settings
<li> Fix ETA
